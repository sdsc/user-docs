Gordon User Guide: Monitoring Your Job
======================================
In this section, we describe some standard tools that you can use to monitor your batch jobs. We suggest that you at least familiarize yourself with the section of the user guide that deals with [running jobs](gordon_running.md) to get a deeper understanding of the batch queuing system before starting this section.

Figuring out where your is job running
--------------------------------------
Using the qstat -n jobid command, you will be able to see a list of nodes allocated to your job. Note that this output does not reflect actual usage, but rather the resources that had been requested. Knowing where your job is running is valuable information since you will be able to access those nodes for the duration of your job to monitor processes, threads, and resource utilization.

The output from qstat -n shown below lists the nodes that have been allocated for job 362256. Note that we have 16 replicates of the node gcn-5-22, each followed by a number corresponding to a compute core on the node.

    [gordonuser@gordon-ln1 ~]$ qstat -n 362256
    gcn-5-22/15+gcn-5-22/14+gcn-5-22/13+gcn-5-22/12
    +gcn-5-22/11+gcn-5-22/10+gcn-5-22/9+gcn-5-22/8
    +gcn-5-22/7+gcn-5-22/6+gcn-5-22/5+gcn-5-22/4
    +gcn-5-22/3+gcn-5-22/2+gcn-5-22/1+gcn-5-22/1

Connecting to a compute node
----------------------------
Under normal circumstances, users cannot log in directly to the compute nodes. This is done to prevent users from bypassing the batch scheduler and possibly interfering with other jobs that may be running on the nodes.

    $ ssh gcn-5-22
    Connection closed by 10.1.254.187
 
Access is controlled by the contents of the /etc/security/access.conf file, which for idle nodes denies access to everyone except root and other administrative users.

    $ cat /etc/security/access.conf 
    -:ALL EXCEPT root (wheel) (xsede-admin) :ALL
 
The situation is different though once a batch job transitions from the queued state to the run state. A special script known as the prologue makes a number of changes to the compute environment, including altering the access.conf file so that the owner of the job running on the node can login.

    $ cat /etc/security/access.conf 
    -:ALL EXCEPT root (wheel) (xsede-admin) gordonuser:ALL 
 
Once the job terminates, a corresponding script known as the epilogue undoes the changes made by the prologue. If you happen to be logged in to a compute node when your job terminates, your session will be terminated.

Static view of threads and processes with ps
--------------------------------------------
Once you login into a compute node, the ps command can provide information about current processes. This is useful if you want to confirm that you are running the expected number of MPI processes, that all MPI processes are in the run state, and that processes are consuming relatively equal amounts of CPU time. The ps command has a large number of options, but two that are suggested are -l (long output) and -u $USER (restrict output to processes owned by username or user ID).

In the following example, we see that we are running 16 MPI processes, named pmemd.MPI in the CMD column, on the compute node gcn-5-22. The TIME column shows that the processes are all using very nearly the same amount of CPU time and the S (state) column shows that these are all in the run (R) state. Not all applications will exhibit such ideal load balancing and processes may sometimes go into a sleep state (D or S) while performing I/O or waiting for an event to complete.

    [gordonuser@gcn-5-22 ~]$ ps -lu $USER
    F S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI  NI ADDR SZ  WCHAN  TTY    TIME CMD

The ps command with the -m option gives thread-level information, with the summed CPU usage for the threads in each process followed by per-thread usage. In the examples below, we first run ps to see the five MPI processes, then use the m option to see the six threads per process.

    [gordonuser@gcn-4-28 ~]$ ps -lu $USER # Processes only
    F S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI  NI ADDR SZ WCHAN  TTY    TIME CMD

Dynamic view of threads and processes with top
----------------------------------------------
While ps gives a static view of the processes, top can be used to provide a dynamic view. By default the output of top is updated every three seconds and lists processes in order of decreasing CPU utilization. Another advantage of top is that it displays the per-process memory usage.

In the first example below, the CPU usage is around 600% for all five processes, indicating that each process had spawned multiple threads. We can confirm this by enabling top to display thread-level information with the H option. (This option can either be specified on the top command line or entered after top is already running)
